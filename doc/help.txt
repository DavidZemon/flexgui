Spin2gui help
=============

Menus
----

The File menu should be pretty self explanatory. You can create a new
file with "New Spin file..." or open an existing one with "Open Spin
file...". At present it is only possible to work with one file at a
time, and that file is the one that will be compiled.

The "Library directory..." entry allows you to pick a directory that
will be searched for OBJ declarations automatically. It defaults to
the lib directory in the spin2gui distribution.

The Edit menu is again pretty self-explanatory. The Undo/Redo
functionality is quite limited; only one level of Redo is reliable,
and trying to Redo again will produce unpredictable results.

"Select Font..." allows you to change the font used for the main
editor window.

The Commands menu allow you to compile, run a binary, or both compile
and run. The current file (the one in the editor window) is always the
one compiled, so it should be your top level Spin file. It will be
saved automatically before any compilation.

Run Binary allows you to choose a binary that you compiled off-line
(or that was compiled earlier) and run it on the device.

Configuring Commands
--------------------
You can change the commands used here for compiling and running
programs. Since the commands are flexible, you can acutally use
spin2gui for compiling and running programs on the P1. The "P1
defaults" button sets the commands for this (you will need to supply
propeller-load.exe yourself). "P2 defaults" restores the settings to
the original Prop2 development.

Config File
-----------
Settings for spin2gui are saved in a file called ".spin2gui.config" in
the HOME directory of the user (usually something like
C:\Users\MyName). If something gets really messed up, deleting that
file will restore spin2gui to its default state.
